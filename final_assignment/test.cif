/* @HIRAM (05_12_2019): This is only a baseline and several changes are necessary, such as, verifying every single requirement and
 making sure consistent wording is kept. Feel free to modify or rename words/variables/edges/states as you see fit.

  @Sukrut(05_12_2019): Added the requirement numbers from the original text (Page 3) to keep track of the requirements,
  I have also divided the requirements based on intention as mentioned in the text. I have kept all the informal statements written by @Hiram,
  they relate to requirement statements in the same order. A PDF of the original text is shared where I have marked already implemented requirements.
  Please refer and update both the files! (Reference: Page 3 of "warehouserobotsproject.pdf")
